# noteboard

One store for notes, todos and ranked lists. API-first, built to be written to
by programs rather than by a person in a text field.

Every record is an **item**. A `type` of `note`, `todo`, `rank` or `workspace`
says what it is; everything else — markdown body, tags, priority, due date,
recurrence rule, parent — is the same set of columns regardless. That is the
whole design: one table, one API, so a todo can be searched alongside a note and
a program never has to pick which store to talk to.

Nothing here destroys data by accident. `DELETE` is reversible, every write
snapshots the row it replaced, and a purge snapshots before it purges.

## Requirements

Go 1.24+. Nothing else — the SQLite driver is [`modernc.org/sqlite`][sqlite],
which is pure Go, so `CGO_ENABLED=0` builds a static binary with FTS5 built in.

[sqlite]: https://modernc.org/sqlite

## Running it

```sh
make build
./bin/noteboard
```

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `NOTEBOARD_PORT` | `8191` | Port to listen on |
| `NOTEBOARD_DB` | `$HOME/.noteboard/noteboard.db` | SQLite file; schema and migrations run on open |

`deploy/noteboard.service` is a `--user` unit. `deploy.sh` reads the binary path,
port and database path back *out of* that unit rather than restating them, then
builds, tests, smokes on a throwaway database, installs, restarts and verifies.

⚠️ **`deploy.sh` will not complete a first-ever deploy against an empty
database.** It asserts `/health` reports more than zero items, which exists to
catch a binary that silently opened the wrong database file. On a fresh install
that assertion is a false alarm. Create an item first, or drop that check.

## Security

**There is no authentication and no authorization.** Every endpoint is open to
anyone who can reach the port, and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is `*`
(`internal/api/api.go:37`), so any web page in any browser that can route to the
host can read and rewrite the whole store. The server binds every interface, not
loopback (`cmd/noteboard/main.go:35`), and there is no option to change that —
`NOTEBOARD_PORT` sets the port only.

`created_by` is a caller-supplied string used as a list filter. **It is not an
identity and nothing checks it.**

There is also no request body size limit, no rate limiting, and no read/write
timeouts on the HTTP server.

This is a deliberate fit for one trusted host behind a firewall. It is **unsafe
on any network you do not control**. Put it behind a reverse proxy that
authenticates, or bind it to loopback, before it can be routed to.

## HTTP API

All bodies are JSON. `OPTIONS` on any path returns `204`.

### Items

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/items` | See filters below |
| `POST` | `/api/items` | `type` and `title` required → `201` |
| `GET` | `/api/items/{id}` | `?include_deleted=true` to fetch a tombstone |
| `PATCH` | `/api/items/{id}` | Partial update; see nullable fields below. Conditional with `If-Match` — see [Saving over someone else's change](#saving-over-someone-elses-change) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/items/{id}` | Reversible; `?hard=true` purges |
| `POST` | `/api/items/{id}/restore` | Undo a delete |
| `GET` | `/api/items/{id}/revisions` | Every prior state, newest first; `?limit=&offset=` to page |
| `POST` | `/api/items/{id}/hold` | Optional `{"reason":…}` |
| `POST` | `/api/items/{id}/unhold` | |
| `GET` | `/api/items/{id}/occurrences` | `?from=&to=` RFC3339; `400` if the item has no schedule |
| `POST` | `/api/items/rerank` | `{"items":[{"id":…,"rank":…}]}` |

**Paging the revision history.** A revision carries the whole body it replaced,
so an item that is rewritten often costs the sum of every version of itself to
read back. Measured 2026-08-21 on this box: one item with 308 revisions answered
`GET /revisions` with **246 MB**. `?limit=` and `?offset=` walk it a page at a
time, newest first. The default is still every revision, so nothing written
before paging existed changes. A `limit` or `offset` that is not a non-negative
integer is a `400` rather than a silent 0 — 0 here means unlimited, which is the
opposite of what a caller passing `?limit=abc` was asking for.

**List filters** on `GET /api/items`: `type`, `tag`, `exclude_tag` (repeatable),
`status`, `list_id`, `created_by`, `parent_id`, `include_deleted`,
`include_held`, `limit` (default 100), `offset`, and `sort` — one of `rank`,
`priority`, `updated_at`, `created_at` (default `created_at` descending).

**Nullable fields on `PATCH`** — `tags`, `links`, `due_at`, `schedule` and
`auto_hold_at_usd` track presence, so an explicit `null` clears the field and
leaving it out means "don't touch". Absent and null are different requests.

### Discovery

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/lists` | `list_id` values with their counts |
| `GET` | `/api/tags` | Every unique tag with its count, most-used first |
| `GET` | `/api/search?q=` | FTS5 over title and body; `&type=`, `&tag=`, `&status=`, `&limit=` (default 50), `&include_held=` |
| `GET` | `/health` | `{"status":"ok","items":N}`; **500** if the database cannot be read |

A **list is not a stored row.** `GET /api/lists` derives the set by grouping
items on `list_id`, so a list exists exactly when an item claims it. There is no
`POST /api/lists` — assign `list_id` on an item instead.

## Behaviors worth knowing before you build on it

**Delete is reversible and is not archiving.** `DELETE` stamps `deleted_at` and
leaves the row in place; it drops out of every read path — list, get, search,
tags, lists, count — and `POST /api/items/{id}/restore` brings it back in
exactly the state it left in. It deliberately does **not** touch `status`:
archived is a state you chose for a live item, deletion is the item being taken
away, and collapsing the two means a restore cannot tell them apart. `?hard=true`
purges the row, and snapshots it into revisions before doing so.

**Revisions are partial.** Every update, delete, restore, hold and unhold writes
a snapshot, but the snapshot covers 8 columns — `title`, `body`, `tags`,
`status`, `priority`, `list_id`, `parent_id`, `links`. It does **not** cover
`rank`, `due_at` or `schedule`, and `POST /api/items/rerank` writes `rank` with
no snapshot at all. Overwrite a recurrence rule and the old rule is gone. Read
before you overwrite.

**Held items are hidden by default, and nothing in the response says so.** A
hold is the user parking work behind a gate: the item stays `open` and stays
visible to a human, but `GET /api/items` and `/api/search` withhold it unless
you pass `include_held=true`. Hold is inherited down `parent_id`, so holding a
parent withholds its whole subtree. An unattended worker should leave that
default alone rather than widening its own search with it.

Hold is deliberately not a `status`. Status is the work's lifecycle; hold is who
is allowed to act on it, and an item can legitimately be both open and held.

**`parent_id` is validated on write.** A parent that names no live item, names a
tombstone, or would close a cycle is refused with `400`. Both the hold gate and
the `auto_hold_at_usd` spend ceiling roll up over that edge, so a dangling
parent would let a child escape an inherited hold.

**`auto_hold_at_usd` is a pointer for a reason.** `null` means no ceiling; `0` is
a real ceiling meaning "hold before spending anything". A plain number would make
those two the same request. The dollars actually spent are not stored on the
item.

**`workspace` is its own type**, not a tagged note: an agent's durable working
memory, rewritten every run. It is a type so it can never be mistaken for work
to do, and so the schema can enforce one per job.

### Saving over someone else's change

Two people open the same item; the first saves; the second's save was made
against a version that is gone. Applied, it overwrites the first one's change
and neither of them sees it happen. A `PATCH` can refuse that:

```bash
# The version is the item's updated_at, exactly as the item carries it.
# GET also sends it as the ETag.
curl -s -X PATCH http://localhost:8191/api/items/<id> \
  -H 'If-Match: "2026-09-18T18:59:29.430695045Z"' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"title":"…"}'
```

- The stored `updated_at` is exactly that → the update is applied, **200**, and
  the answer's `ETag` is the new version.
- It is anything else → **412** `{"error":…,"current":{…the item as it is now…}}`.
  Nothing is written and no revision is taken. Show the difference, then retry
  against `current.updated_at`.
- No `If-Match`, or `If-Match: *` → applied whatever the version, as every
  `PATCH` was before this existed. The check is the caller's to ask for.
- An `If-Match` that is not one `updated_at` → **400**. It is not ignored: its
  sender believes the update is conditional.

The check and the write are one step against every other `PATCH`
(`Store.itemUpdateMutex`); without that, of sixteen saves made at once against
one version, as many as fourteen were applied
(`TestOnlyOneOfManyConcurrentSavesAgainstOneVersionWins`). Hold, unhold, delete,
restore and rerank also move `updated_at`, so a save made before one of those is
refused too — the item did change. They take no precondition themselves.

### Recurrence

Any item can carry a `schedule` — an RFC 5545 rule for when it falls due and
when it nudges. `due_at` stays the single source of truth for when the item is
next due; the schedule is the rule that *generates* that answer, and `dtstart`
is the series anchor, not the current due date.

```json
{
  "dtstart": "2026-07-21T09:00:00-07:00",
  "tzid": "America/Los_Angeles",
  "rrule": "FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=3TU",
  "mode": "instance",
  "remind": {"lead": ["-P1D"], "channels": ["digest"]}
}
```

- **`tzid` is mandatory whenever a rule is present and is never defaulted.** An
  offset is not a zone: a rule anchored to `-07:00` cannot know what happens at
  a DST transition and silently drifts an hour twice a year.
- **`mode`** — `instance` (default) materializes each occurrence as a child item,
  so a consumer sees ordinary todos and never has to understand recurrence.
  `rolling` keeps one row whose `due_at` advances on completion, with no history.
- **`remind.lead`** takes ISO-8601 offsets before due (`-P1D`), calendar-aware.
- **`remind.nag`** is a second rule that repeats until the item is done.
- An invalid rule is rejected at write time rather than expanding to nothing.

Check `GET /api/items/{id}/occurrences?from=&to=` before trusting a rule —
`BYDAY=3TU` and `BYDAY=TU;BYSETPOS=3` read alike and diverge in months that
start on a Tuesday. Occurrences are capped at 500 per list, and the response
sets `truncated` when the cap was hit.

`rdate` and `exdate` modify the **due** series only. They do not move the nag: an
extra due date does not buy an extra nag, and a skipped due week still nags.

## Development

```sh
make vet
make test
./scripts/e2e-smoke.sh   # boots the real binary on a throwaway DB and drives it over HTTP
```

The smoke test is what catches the failures the compiler cannot: a build without
FTS5 compiles green and fails at `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE`, and a Go 1.22+
`ServeMux` route conflict compiles green and panics at boot.
