// Package boundedtext renders a string or an error at a length that does not
// depend on the input that produced it.
//
// It exists because noteboard hands a caller's own input back inside its 400s,
// and this service has no auth at all: ~/CLAUDE.md records it listening on
// *:8191 with no firewall rule, so anything that can route to this host can
// choose the length of a response body.
//
// Measured against the deployed binary on :8191 before the repair, with a 5 KB
// query parameter or field:
//
//	POST /api/items  schedule.remind.lead     15 183 bytes
//	GET  .../occurrences?from=               10 116
//	GET  .../occurrences?to=                 10 114
//	GET  /api/items/<id>/<action>             5 034
//	POST /api/items  schedule.remind.channels  5 114
//	POST /api/items  schedule.tzid             5 076
//	POST /api/items  schedule.mode             5 072
//
// Three sizes, and the reason for each is worth knowing before repairing one:
//
//   - 1x is the statement quoting the value with %q and nothing more.
//   - 2x is a stdlib parser quoting its whole input back inside its own error.
//     time.Parse does it twice, so a bare err.Error() is already 2x.
//   - 3x is both at once: the statement prints the value AND wraps the parser's
//     error, which is carrying its own copy. That is remind.lead above.
//
// So bounding one half is not a partial fix, it is an invisible one. At the 3x
// site a 60-byte cut on the value alone would still have rendered 10 KB, and
// the truncate call sitting there reads exactly like a bound that holds.
//
// The intuition also points the wrong way about WHICH parser is dangerous.
// Measured here against strings.Repeat("x", 5000):
//
//	time.Parse            10 073 bytes   embeds the input, twice
//	strconv.Atoi           5 040         embeds the input
//	time.LoadLocation         18         does not
//
// and noteboard's own parseRRule does not either — a 5 KB rrule answers 70
// bytes and a 5 KB remind.nag answers 75. Two of the six schedule fields that
// look identical in the source are not defects, which is why every site this
// package is applied to was measured rather than pattern-matched.
//
// The error is worth carrying at its realistic length rather than dropping: for
// an ordinary bad timestamp it says something the value alone does not, such as
// "month out of range". A repair that blanks the message satisfies every
// ceiling and destroys the only thing the field is for.
