// fresh database while anything else held that file failed to open at all, and
// reported it as whichever statement happened to open the connection — in
// memory-store, where this was first found, that was "create schema: database is
// locked", which sent every reader to the schema for months.
//
// Holding a write transaction on the fresh file makes the race deterministic
// rather than roughly-half-the-time. Against the DSN version this fails on every
// run, and it fails instantly: the 0s is the assertion, because a store that had
// honoured its own 5s busy_timeout would have outlasted a 150ms lock.

// does not recognise instead of rejecting it, so the mattn-style spelling this
// store used to carry applied nothing and said nothing; and a lost journal_mode
// race can report the mode the file stayed on rather than an error. Asserting on
// the pragmas, not on the DSN string, is what makes this unfakeable.
